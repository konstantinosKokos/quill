# 🪶 Quill 

Quill is a WIP attempt at a structurally faithful neural representation of Agda terms, with a current application in premise selection.

## 📦 Installation

**1.** Clone or download this repository.

```shell
  git clone git@github.com:konstantinosKokos/quill.git
```

**2.** Initialize a fresh python environment (e.g. using [Miniconda](https://docs.anaconda.com/miniconda/)).


 ```shell
   conda create --name quill python=3.12
 ``` 

**3.** Activate the environment, and install the package and its dependencies.

```shell
  conda activate quill
  pip install .
``` 

**Note**: *This will install the cpu version of pytorch by default. For CUDA acceleration, you will need to manually
find and install compatible pytorch and pytorch geometric versions.*

**4.** Download a pretrained model's weights through [here](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/58i2mhpfkctp9lasw3fc6/model.pt?rlkey=8dhc69p9798r9drskcx06j449&st=talhqkgl&dl=0).

**Note**: *Optional. Only relevant for inference/evaluation.*

**5.** Download the tokenized and processed Agda files from [here](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/bnw4rh6lq5xb7r8j5adpc/tokenized.p?rlkey=ml4h4qpv4n4vrp5c0ysqyus6k&st=neg9zynu&dl=0).  

**Note**: *Optional. Only relevant for training/evaluation.*

You can **uninstall** by removing the environment from your system, and deleting all downloaded files.

## ❓ How-To

### 🪿 Interface with Agda

> 🚧 **Note**: Work in Progress 🚧

You should be able to export an Agda file (possibly containing holes) into json format 
(see [agda2train](https://github.com/omelkonian/agda2train)), and then invoke a script that looks like `/scripts/inference.py`
to obtain lemma suggestions.

The second part of this process is partially streamlined through a CLI API.

First, deploy a server running the model in inference mode:

```shell
  agda-quill serve -config PATH_TO_MODEL_CONFIG -weights PATH_TO_MODEL_WEIGHTS
```

You can then optionally precompute representations of the lemmas defined in various files/libraries:

```shell
  agda-quill cache -files ./data/stdlib/Data.List.*
```

Finally, you can query the model for suggestions, optionally using the cached representations:
```shell
  agda-quill query -file ./data/stdlib/Algebra.Construct.NaturalChoice.Min.json --max_suggestions 2 --use_cache
```

### 🤖 Train a model ...

#### ... on the original train/dev split 
Adjust the training configuration file (`/data/config.json`) and run the training script (`/scripts/train.py`), after any necessary modifications.

#### ... on a new dataset
Gather a bunch of JSON exports over an Agda library of your choice (again, using [agda2train](https://github.com/omelkonian/agda2train)).
Run the preprocessing script (`/scripts/preprocess.py`) to have Python parse and tokenize the exports.
Then train as you would normally.

### 📈 Evaluate a model
Run the evaluation script (`/scripts/validate.py`), after any necessary modifications. 

### 🔎 Inspect the parsed & tokenized files
The Python definitions of Agda file- and term-structures can be found in `src/quill/data/agda/syntax.py`.
The definitions of tokenized files can be found in `/src/quill/data/tokenization.py`. 
Use them as you see fit to navigate and process the parsed & tokenized files. 
You can load these with:
```python3
import pickle

with open('./data/tokenized_sample.p', 'rb') as f:
    samples = pickle.load(f)
```

### 🖼️ Visualize lemma representations
For a low-dimensional projection of the neural representations of (most) lemmas in the stdlib,
together with their undirectional reference structure, look here: https://konstantinoskokos.github.io/quill/viz.html.
